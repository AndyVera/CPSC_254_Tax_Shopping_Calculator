# CPSC 254 Project: Shopping Tax Calculator
## Group Members:

## Purpose:
The purpose of this application is to calculate the grand total of a transaction including
tax. This would include analyzing the objects in a transaction and figuring which items does tax
apply. To elaborate, Grocery Items do not have tax applied to them but General Merchandise
does. Furthermore, the percentage of tax will depend on the location or city since different cities
have different tax rates. An example being, Rosemead, California has a tax of 9.5% while Bell
Gardens, California has a tax rate of 10.25%

## Background:
This idea was created based on the experience of being a cashier at a retail store. A
common scenario that is seen almost every single day is customers asking why the total comes
out different from the price of the item listed on the shelf. Most of the time, customers don’t
realize there is Sales Tax applied to it. For those who know, they seem to question the percentage
of the Sales Tax and if it is accurate. Oftentimes, I (Andy Vera) would have to do these
calculations through a smartphone’s calculator and demonstrate to them that it is accurate.
Another dilemma that occurs is customers overestimate the total and don’t have enough. This
causes them to try to decide which items to remove at the time of being at a register which can
hold up the line and cause the rest of the line to be quite annoyed. 

With the proposal of this idea, customers can calculate their Grand Total of their current
shopping with Tax included. They will be able to see if they have the sufficient funds before
checking out, saving time and a headache for customers. Additionally, customers will be able to
select what city they are shopping in to be given the corresponding Sales Tax Rate.
